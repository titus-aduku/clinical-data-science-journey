# Clinical Data Science Journey

This repository documents my project-based learning path to becoming a Clinical Data Scientist, leveraging my background as a Registered Nurse with a focus on solving problems in Ghanaian healthcare.

## My Professional Workbench

This setup is my digital equivalent of a clean, organized, and sterile workspace for handling clinical data.

*   **Operating Room (Environment Manager):** Anaconda Distribution
    *   **Purpose:** Manages all my software tools and libraries, preventing project dependencies from interfering with each otherâ€”like ensuring two different clinical trials use the correct, isolated versions of a specific drug protocol.

*   **Surgical Trays (Conda Environments):**
    *   **Purpose:** I will create a separate, isolated environment for each major project. This ensures that every project has its own specific set of tools, preventing conflicts.

*   **Diagnostic Monitor & Control Panel (IDE):** Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
    *   **Purpose:** My central hub for all work: writing code, analyzing data with Jupyter Notebooks, and managing my project history with Git.

*   **Surgical Notes & Case Archive (Version Control):** Git & GitHub
    *   **Purpose:** Git provides a meticulous, unchangeable, time-stamped record of every change I make to my code. GitHub is the central, secure, cloud-based archive where these records are stored, allowing for collaboration and showcasing my work.
